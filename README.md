# Working_with_pytorch_MNIST
Creating and comparing a dense neural network as well as a convolutional neural network (LeNet) for classification of the digits in the MNIST datasets. Comparison is done based on varying learning rates, batchsizes, convergence of Loss,etc. Graphs are plotted wherever needed based on the data generated during training. Please refer to Problem_Statement.pdf for the prblem solved and refer to the notebooks:
17AE3FP06-1.ipynb contains the creation and analysis logs of the dense NN.
17AE3FP06-2.ipynb contains the creation and analysis logs of the Convolutional NN LeNet.

Thank you! This is my first experience with Pytorch. I am more of a keras guy!!
